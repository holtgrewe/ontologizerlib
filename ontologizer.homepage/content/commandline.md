The command-line version of Ontologizer can be used for batch processing or pipelines. Most general users will prefer the Java WebStart version, though.

Installation
------------

If you want to use the command-line version, you need just need to download the [Ontologizer.jar](/cmdline/Ontologizer.jar) file.


Installation under Debian
-------------------------

Users that run Debian or a Debian-based distribution are recommended to install the command-line version of Ontologizer
from Ontologizer's Debian repository hosted at Bintray. To do so, first import Bintray's public key:

```
 $ su
 $ apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 379CE192D401AB61
```

Then add the Ontologizer repository to your ```sources.list``` file and update the package database like this:

```
 $ echo deb [arch=all] https://dl.bintray.com/ontologizer/deb unstable main >>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/ontologizer.list
 $ apt-get update
```

You are now ready to install Ontologizer:
```
 $ apt-get install ontologizer-cli
 $ exit
```

You may need to install the Debian package `apt-transport-https` prior these steps in order to allow downloading packages
via the `https` protocol.


Help
----

Ontologizer is a Java-Application and if you downloaded the [Ontologizer.jar](/cmdline/Ontologizer.jar) jar file, you need to start it via the `java` command.
But if you installed it via the Debian repository, you can invoke it more conveniently via the ```ontologizer``` wrapper script.

All possible command arguments along with a short description can be viewed via the `--help` argument. E.g.

```
$ java -jar Ontologizer.jar --help
```
or
```
$ ontologizer --help
```
will produce following output:

```

In order to do something useful, Ontologizer must be started with several arguments (as indicated with "Required" within the output above).

Required Arguments
------------------

First, you are required to specify the `-g` (or `--go`) option. This defines the path to a file which contains the GO terminology and structure. Ontologizer is able to parse files in the OBO format. Such are available directly at the GO Website from http://geneontology.org/page/download-ontology.

Second, you are required to specify the `-a` option which defines the mapping of gene names to GO terms. The GO Website provides association files for a variety of organisms, as well. See http://geneontology.org/page/download-annotations.

Third, you must specify a population file with the `-p` option. This file contains all gene names (one per line) of the population set, e.g. the names of the genes of your microarray.

Last, you need to specify the path to your study set(s) with the `-s` option. This can either be a single file for a single study set or a directory, in which case all files (ending with `*.txt`) are considered as separate study sets. As for the population file, one line represents only a single gene name.

When started with these four parameters only, the output of Ontologizer's calculation is written to a basic ascii table file into the same directory where the study files are located. The table's filename is derived from the name of the study set in question but prepended with "table-" string.

Optional Arguments
------------------

Using the `-d` option, you can instruct Ontologizer to create a graphical output of the results. For every study set, a file (name is prepended with "view-") is written which can be read by the graphviz `dot` tool to produce a viewable graphics file. In this file, terms are depicted by nodes and their hierarchical relations are depicted by edges. Because the GO DAG contains a huge amount of terms, the graph is constructed only for significant terms and their predecessors (up to the source) and those significant terms are highligthed. Which terms are considered as significant is influenced by their p-values and the significance threshold. This threshold is specified as a parameter to the -d argument. It must be a valid floating point value ranging from 0 to 0.5. For example use `-d 0.05` to define those terms as significant whose p-value falls below 0.05.

In addition, you can specify a GO Term ID, after the floating-point value (separated by ","). In this case only the subgraph starting at this term is written. For example use `-d 0.05,8152` to get only a graph with the term id `GO:0008152 (metabolism)` and its successors within the subgraph emanating from `GO:0008152` such that all significantly overrepresented terms are included in the graph.

Some sample datasets and population sets can be downloaded from this page.
To perform parent-child analysis using Westphal-Young MTC on the Yeast data set from the tutorial page and display the results using dot, enter the following command:

```
$ java -jar Ontologizer.jar -a gene_association.sgd -g gene_ontology.obo -s study/4hourSMinduced.txt -p population.txt -c Parent-Child-Union -m Westfall-Young-Single-Step -d 0.05 -r 1000
```

The corresponding files must be in the current directory (or their full path must be indicated). To create a PNG image with the result, enter

```
$ dot -Tpng view-4hourSMinduced-Parent-Child-Westfall-Young-Single-Step.dot -oExample.png
```

The corresponding graphic should look something like this:
![Dot Example](/images/Example.png)

This requires that you have Graphviz installed.
