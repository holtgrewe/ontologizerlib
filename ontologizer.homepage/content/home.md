Ontologizer is a tool for the statistical analysis and visualization of high-throughput biological
data using Gene Ontology. Most conveniently, it can be started via the Java Webstart facility:

[![Webstart](/images/webstart.jpg)](/webstart/ontologizer.jnlp)
</center>

Note however that the Webstart facility will no longer work by default with recent versions of
the Java runtime due to increased security settings. See the [Webstart]({{< relref "webstart.md" >}})
section for details.

A preliminary Web version that does not rely on Webstart but uses modern Web standards is
available from the [Web Ontologizer]({{< relref "webontologizer.md" >}}) section.
