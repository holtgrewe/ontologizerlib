The Web-based Ontologizer is a slim version of the Ontologizer that is directly
executed in modern Web browsers. Thus, unlike the traditional Ontologizer, no Java
installation is needed. Note however, that this is in an alpha state and thus very
limited. Please report any findings here: https://github.com/sba1/ontologizer/issues.
